#Welcome to [Rdio Karaoke](http://rdiokaraoke.com)

Rdio Karaoke was created by Rachel Adler as her capstone project for the Ada Developers Academy.

To use this app, sign-in to or sign-up for Rdio using the link below. Once you are signed in, create a playlist and then add the karaoke songs you want to the playlist.

Rdio Karaoke is powered by [Rdio](http://rdio.com) and [MusixMatch](http://musixmatch.com).

Thank you to all of my friends, TAs, and instructors at Ada who helped me with this app, as well as Varun from MusixMatch!
